# HTTP Header Checker

HTTP Header Checker is a Python script designed to check the HTTP response headers of a target URL or IP address. It helps you identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the HTTP headers of a web server. The script checks various headers, such as Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Public-Key-Pins, and Content-Security-Policy (CSP), and provides insights into their configurations.

## Features

- Checks various HTTP headers for security misconfigurations.
- Provides detailed information about security risks and solutions.
- Supports checking specific headers or all headers.
- Offers color-coded output for easy interpretation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed:

- `argparse`: For parsing command-line arguments.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the target.
- `termcolor`: For coloring the output.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install argparse requests termcolor
